## Descriptive Statistics

### Statistics

**Statistics** are the summarization of a set of data that has been collected, which demonstrates random variation. *Extracting meaning from data*.

### Inferential Statistics

**Inferential Statistics** make inferences about a situation based on data, such as forecasting. Descriptive statistics can be the basis for inferences.

### Representative Values

* Mean - *The sum of all numbers in a list divided by the number of items in the list*
* Median - *The middle value in a list ordered from smallest to largest*
* Mode - *The most frequently occuring value in a list*
* Range - *[Min, Max]*
* Variance - *Average of deviation from the mean squared*
* Standard Deviation - *Measure of average absolute deviation*
* Skewness - *Measure of the shape of the distribution **function***
* Quantiles - *Generalization of the median to percentiles*
  
### Observational vs. Experimental Data

Experimental Data involves manipulating objects to determine cause and effect in data. Observational Data refers to data extrapolated from naturally occurring events.

## Basic Probability

### Probability Calculus

Probability events have a total probability between zero and one.

\begin{equation}
    Pr[\textrm{An Event}] = 1
\end{equation}

An event that is sure to happen
{:.figcaption}

The definition of probability for how often an event is observed can be related to the number of repetions of the experiment.

\begin{equation}
    Pr[\textrm{Heads}] = \frac{\textrm{Number } k \textrm{ of Heads in }N \textrm{ coin tosses}}{N \textrm{ coin tosses}}
\end{equation}

Counting the probability of heads in a set of coin tosses

The larger the number of repetiions, the higher accuracy with which we can predict the likelihood of an event happening.

### Probability Model

#### Events

Events are elements in the set of possible outcomes in an experiment.

#### Sample Space

The set of all possible outcomes for an experiment.

\begin{equation}
    S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}
\end{equation}

The sample space for a dice roll
{:.figcaption}

\begin{equation}
    A_1 = \{1\}, A_2 = \{1,2,5\}
\end{equation}

Subsets containing events in the sample space
{:.figcaption}

The complement of a subset $$A^C$$ is the subset of all other events in the sample space which are not contained in $$A$$.

### Event Algebra

#### Or

The combination of two or more sets.

For $$A = \{1,2,5\}$$ and $$B = \{3, 4\}$$, $$A_1 + A_2 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$$

#### And

The set of events which occur in two or more sets.

For $$A = \{1,2,3, 5\}$$ and $$B = \{3, 4\}$$, $$A_1A_2 = \{3\}$$

#### Axioms

* Mutual exclusion: $$AA^c = 0$$
* Inclusion: $$AS = A$$
* Double complement: $$(A^C)^C = A$$
* Commutation: $$A_1 + A_2 = A_2 + A_1$$
* Associativity: $$A_1 + (A_2 + A_3) = (A_1 + A_2) + A_3$$
* Distributivity: $$A_1 (A_2 + A_3) = A_1A_2 + A_1A_3$$
* DeMorganâ€™s Law: $$(A_1A_2)^c = (A_1)^C + (A_2)^C$$
