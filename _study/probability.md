## Descriptive Statistics

### Statistics
**Statistics** are the summarization of a set of data that has been collected, which demonstrates random variation. *Extracting meaning from data*.
### Inferential Statistics
**Inferential Statistics** make inferences about a situation based on data, such as forecasting. Descriptive statistics can be the basis for inferences.
### Representative Values

- Mean - *The sum of all numbers in a list divided by the number of items in the list*
- Median - *The middle value in a list ordered from smallest to largest*
- Mode - *The most frequently occuring value in a list*
- Range - *[Min, Max]*
- Variance - *Average of deviation from the mean squared*
- Standard Deviation - *Measure of average absolute deviation*
- Skewness - *Measure of the shape of the distribution **function***
- Quantiles - *Generalization of the median to percentiles*
  
###  Observational vs. Experimental Data
Experimental Data involves manipulating objects to determine cause and effect in data. Observational Data refers to data extrapolated from naturally occurring events.
## Basic Probability
### Probability Calculus
Probability events have a total probability between zero and one.

\begin{equation}
    Pr[\textrm{An Event}] = 1
\end{equation}

An event that is sure to happen

The definition of probability for how often an event is observed can be related to the number of repetions of the experiment.

\begin{equation}
    Pr[\textrm{Heads}] = \frac{\textrm{Number } k \textrm{ of Heads in }N \textrm{ coin tosses}}{N \textrm{ coin tosses}}
\end{equation}

Counting the probability of heads in a set of coin tosses
{:.figcaption}

The larger the number of repetiions, the higher accuracy with which we can predict the likelihood of an event happening.
